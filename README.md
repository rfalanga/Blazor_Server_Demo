# Blazor_Server_Demo

I'm following along in a tutorial named "Building Modern Web Applications Using Blazor ASP.NET Core" by Joydip Kanjilal, in the March/April 2025 edition of CODE Magazine. This application is from the section of that article, titled, "Create a New Blazor Server Applicaiton in .NET 9 and Visual Studio 2022".

## The Blazor Server App

This section required the student to create a new Blazor Server application in .NET 9 and Visual Studio 2022. The student was required to create a new Blazor Server application using ASP.NET Core 8. However, on my dev box that version was not available for a Blazor Server App, and I'm sure I have .NET 8 installed. The best I could do was .NET 7, which by this time is out of support.

## The Blazor Hybrid App

At this point in the tutorial I was advised to create a new Blazor Hybrid application in .NET 9 and Visual Studio 2022. I was able to do this, and the application is running. The instructions recommended that I clear the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox as well as the **do not use top-level statements** checkbox. When adding this second project to the solution, those two options were never shown to me.
